THIS APPLICATION FULFILLED THE FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS :

Build a JSP/Servlet based web HR application that will - 
1. Provide a login page for HR Manager
2. HR Manager can add Employees and see the list of employees
3. HR Manager can update/delete employees

4. Employee can log in and see his details as added by HR Manager. 

So we have 2 different users - HR Manager once login can see/add/update/employees

Employee, once logged in, can only see his details
